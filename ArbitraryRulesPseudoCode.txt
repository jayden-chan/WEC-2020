I'm assuming that stocks is an array of type stock that stores a particular 
stock's information for a specific day. Type stock has at least one variable called 
val which stores the value for that day.This is done 

rule 1
if (halfway != null && current == recoverDeadline) {
    if (stocks[current].val < halfway){
        sell();
    }
}

if (halfway == null && stocks[current].val <= stocks[current-1].val * 0.85 ){
    halfway = stocks[current-1].val * 0.92.5;
    recoverDeadline= current + 7;
}

Rule 2
if (risingSell != null && current == sellDeadline) {
    if (stocks[current].val > risingSell){
        sell();
    }
}

if (risinSell == null && stocks[current].val > stocks[current-2].val * 1.2) {
    risingSell = stocks[current].val * 1.05;
    sellDeadline == current + 2;
}


Rule 3
if (average(stocks, current) > 1.15) {
    buy();
}

double average(stocks company, int endDay) {
    int day = endDay - 30;
    double runningTally = 0;
    while(day < endDay){
        runninTally += company[day].val;
    }
   return runningTally/30;
}
